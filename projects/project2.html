			<h1>Collabortaion platform</h1>

			<p>
				The goal of collaboration platform is to create a digitale space, that will help teams or groups to manage their project.
				<p>The application can handle tasks for now, but I have a lot of things which I would like to implement. </p>
			</p>	
				<p>I give special attention to application architecture:
					<ul>
					<li>trying to build application with common good practices.</li>
					<li>trying to keep my code clean </li>
					<li>use aproved and best solutions</li>
					</ul>
					So, in sum, I prefer to write less code and spent more time thinking how to do it in a better way.</p>
